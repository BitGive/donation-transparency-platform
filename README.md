# BitGive Donation Transparency Platform

## Background
Our [Charity 2.0 Initiative](http://bitgivefoundation.org/bitcoin-charity-2-0-initiative/) launched with our inaugural project to build the **BitGive Donation Transparency Platform** for donors and nonprofits using blockchain technology! This new platform will revolutionize philanthropy â€“ allowing donors and the public to trace nonprofit transactions on a public platform in real time to see how funds are spent, ensure they reach their final destination, and track the results generated from contributions.

This will help reward good actors, educate donors, and identify & avoid fraudulent activities that occur along traditional paths. The implementation of the platform can be used domestically, and will also significantly increase access to funds in the developing world while reducing the friction, transaction time, and exorbitant fees of traditional cross-border transactions.

We may not be able to stop natural disasters from happening, curb severe weather events, or solve all the problems of corruption around the globe, but we can implement a new system using the most innovative technology available today. Bitcoin and Blockchain technology is an amazing innovation that provides the means to not only transfer funds directly, securely, and at significantly lower cost; but to also broadcast every transaction on a public ledger, allowing everyone to see exactly where the funds go and the impact they have. Our Platform will build upon the existing core technology a customized platform for nonprofits that is data centered, user friendly, and provides a comprehensive user interface.

Our initial MVP (minimum viable product) is currently being built in partnership with [The Water Project](https://thewaterproject.org/) and [BitPesa](https://www.bitpesa.co/) to support projects in western Kenya. Future phases of the project will build out a broadly-applicable platform, data analysis layers, feedback loops, reporting mechanisms, and more.

We have just begun the challenging and exciting process of developing this platform, so please check back for updates as we make progress!
